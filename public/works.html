                    A very interesting cross-disciplinary project. The challenge
                    was to create a website (commercial or not) including a
                    mechanism that benefits ethics, charity and/or sustainable
                    development.

                    We have chosen to position ourselves around the loss of
                    animals.

                  <p>
                    Although the project could not be fully developed, we still
                    developed the backend and the main features.<br />My goal on
                    this project was also to use React.js with a backend on a
                    web application project to increase my skills.

                    For this week, my team and I focused our work around jeans.
                    To highlight the second hand and to raise awareness about
                    the pollution of textile products.

                    The constraints were to gather all the projects of the
                    agency in a website and of course to introduce the agency,
                    its poles and its members.

                    It was my first realization for a real client.

                    had one week for the design and one week for the
                    integration, the website had to be manageable by the client
